# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in the project! Before contributing, please keep in mind:
* It is a good idea to raise either a **Feature Request**, **Bug Report** or **Question** before making hard contributions. This often saves a lot of time, ensuring you have not made a redundant contribution. 
* Deliberate and get feedback from the community on your ideas or possible solutions.
* Make sure that your contribution brings value.
  * Please avoid trivial-only contributions like fixing formatting issues or renaming variables. You can still make these kinds of changes, if you accompany them with valuable contributions.
  * Apart from feature implementation and bugfixes, we consider valuable: Performance enhancements, architecture improvements, documentation clarifications and fixes, unit and integration testing, logo and design changes

We look forward to collaborate with you in the future!
