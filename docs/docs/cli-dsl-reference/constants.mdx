You can define constants for data that you want to use multiple times throughout your Toolchain.

<Constants/>

```sh title="Console"
$ my-toolchain
My Dear Constant Value
```

# Scope

Constants are visible in both the defined scope and the child scopes.

<Scope/>

```sh title="Console"
$ my-toolchain my-child
Child My Dear Constant Value
```

# Interpolation

You can use interpolation when assigning a value to a constant. Reference other
constants or even parameters.

<Interpolation/>

```sh title="Console"
$ my-toolchain my-child
Child My Dear Constant Value
```
